Freshman CTF Challenge - Cookies
================================

A super-simple CTF challenge where you must modify a cookie. Written hastily and probably fairly poorly (is it even possible to not write bad code in PHP?).

Just put it up on a webserver, point your config at the `www` folder (letting people access `inc` is obviously a no-no), make sure PHP is working, and you should be good to go.
